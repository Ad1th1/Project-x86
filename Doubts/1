1. When adding two number how to get the answer back in decimal form? Tried daa. Didn't work
Also how to see data segment clearly?

data segment
num1 db 1h
num2 db 2h
sum db 00h
carry db 00h
data ends

code segment
assume cs:code,ds:data
start:
mov ax, data
mov ds, ax

mov al,num1
mov bl,num2
adc al,bl
daa

mov dl,al

mov ah,2
int 21h

mov ah,4ch
int 21h

code ends
end start
