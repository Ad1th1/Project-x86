This instruction reads a character from the keyboard or writes a character to the
standard output device. 
If the DL register contains a value between 00H-FEH, it
displays the character on screen. If the DL register contains FFH, and a character
is ready, AL register contains the character input and Zero Flag is SET.
If the character is not ready when DL register contains FFH, Zero Flag is RESET
and AL register contains 00H
-> ZF set if no character available and AL = 00h
-> ZF clear if character available AL = character read


-> to debug, type debug file_name.asm
   t -> to trace through program
   q -> to get out of the program

-> var1 db 'a'  ; to store a character
-> var1 db 'hello$'  ; to store a string

-> ascii to hex -> 1 => 31

-> Packed BCD is the first and second number are represented as the first 4 bits and last 4 bits in a byte. The number 75 in packed BCD would be 01110101. Unpacked BCD 
is each number is represented by its own byte. The number 75 in unpacked BCD would be 00000111 and 00000101.
