-> 8086 = 40 pin IC

-> 8255 has a better I/O interfacing capability
-> has 24 I/O pins -> grouped in two 8 bit parallel ports: A and B, with remaining 8 bits in port C
-> Port C -> used as induvidual bits / 4 bit ports : Cupper & Clower
-> Operates in these modes
    -> I/O modes (mode 0, mode 1, mode 2)
    -> BSR(bit set reset) mode
    
 Control Signals in 8255
 -> RD (Read) = active low = reads data from selected port of 8255
 -> WR (Write) = active low = writes data to selected port of 8255
 -> A0 and A1 = to select port a,b,c
 -> Reset = Active high signal = clears control registers and sets all ports to input mode
