**What is x86**
-> enhanced micro-processor designed by Intel 
-> 16 bit micro-processor with 20 address lines and 16 data lines that provides upto 1 MB storage

**Features of 8086**
-> has an instruction queue that is capable of storing 6 instruction bytes from memory - resulting in faster processing
-> 16 bit microprocessor with 20-bit address line
